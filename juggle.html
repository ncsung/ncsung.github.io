                <div class= "project-disc">
                    <p>Juggle is an application interface design project, where we were to design an application with the brief: 
                      <br>
                      <br><em>The new balance between in-person and on-line activities for users in a professional context.</em>
                      <br>
                      <br>This project’s pipeline was to select a Design Domain and to conduct user research. To understand the needs, goals, and the details of a potential application opportunity, coming out of the pandemic.

                      <h3>Ideation</h3>
                      <div class= "project-disc">
                        <p>With the user domain in mind, we started mocking up potential applications ideas. Since it is the initial planning process, we broadened the scope of the apps features because it would be easier to narrow down our idea’s as we progressed and had a greater feel for our application. My first idea was to create a to-do list with an emphasis on event connections, aiding our users to connect with events such as marketplaces, workshops, and conventions. Margaret suggested that we should also provide resources to aid our users in learning more about the business aspects of professional development. We then locked in this idea by creating a simple wireframe.</p>
                        <div class =" bleed image-holder-three">
                            <img src = "assets/juggle/ideate1-small.jpg" alt="image of juggle wireframe dashboard">
                            <img src = "assets/juggle/ideate2-small.jpg" alt="image of juggle wireframe calendar" >
                            <img src = "assets/juggle/ideate3-small.jpg" alt="image of juggle wireframe event page">
                        </div>
                        <p> The next phase of our app design, we decided that we should narrow down the features of Juggle because the learning resource, event connecting, and to-do-list features felt disjointed and could have been three different apps on its own. We decided to focus on the to-do feature of our app and to really specialize it towards our domain group. We accomplished this by implementing features that would help users plan their day, organize between their professional projects and personal project, and organize the necessary applications that tie to their projects. We aimed this calendar to be a central hub for our user’s productivity.  
                        </p>

                    <h3>Interaction Iterations</h3>
                    <div class= "project-disc">
                      <p>I designed our interactions for project creation and task planning. I designed with the goal for satisfying micro-interactions of dragging and dropping tasks to plan.</p>
                      <div class ="image-holder">
                          <img srcset= "assets/juggle/drag-drop-small.gif 400w, assets/juggle/drag-drop.gif 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 62.5rem) 50vw, 100vw" src="assets/juggle/drag-drop.gif" alt="Gif of Juggle Drag and Drop" width="231" height="500">
                      </div>

                      <p> Through user testing, the biggest issues participants found in the to-do list were text sizes, placement and contrast of buttons. 
                      </p>
                      <div class ="image-holder two">

                      </div>
                      <p>
                        User testing, on the project adding page found greater issues in copy writing. The titles of our text entry field proved to be confusing for our users, setting them up for wrong naming conventions and frustrations.    
                      </p>

                  <h3>Reflection</h3>
                  <div class ="project-disc">
                  <p>The scope of this project was very large, and our time was limited. This project has taught me the lesson that design thinking needs to be always for users and not for myself! This fact was further driven through seeing the reactions of the user testers and points of confusion when learning the application. </p>
